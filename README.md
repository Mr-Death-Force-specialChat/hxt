## using visual studio on windows
bad at compiling c#????<br>
here are X steps to do it<br>
- grab a copy of _`Program.cs`_<br>
- Make a ***new*** visual studio solution (solution for linux later) for a console app<br>
- Grab that _`Program.cs`_<br> and replace the original _`Program.cs`_ from the vss project<br>
- vs->build->build
- Profit!
## using linux to build it
this requires some stuff<br>
- [x] linux (required to build on ***linux***)
- [x] virtual machine program
- [x] windows iso (current stable windows is 10)
- [x] visual studio (i use community edition) for windows<br>
enough talks lets get started<br>
- create a new windows vm in the virtual machine software/program/etc
- install visual studio on the windows vm
- do what the using vs on win does
- Profit!
## using mac
first what do _i_ need to do
- [ ] use mac
- [ ] understand mac
